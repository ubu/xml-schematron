The infamous TODO list. Patches welcome :>

XML::Schematron
* Decouple the constructor from the SAX Parser so we can:
  a) just pass an array of tests generated from some other method (and add a method to do so).
  b) just pass a 'precompiled' XSLT script for validation

* Allow the constructor/validate methods to accept FILEHANDLEs and strings in addition to just file names.

* We Need Test Scripts!!!!

XML::Schematron::Sablotron
* Add the ability to specify genereated XSLT scripts for validation rather that forcing a parse of the original schema each
time.

XML::Schematron::XPath
